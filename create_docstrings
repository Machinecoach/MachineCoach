# Docstrings
# Always enclose docstrings in triple quotes (makes it easier to expand on later)
# First line should be summary sentence of functionality
# Modules: List important classes, functions and exceptions
# For Classes: list important methods
# For Functions: Make sure you:
  # List paremeters and explain each, one per line
  # If there's a return value, then list it, otherwise omit
  # If the fucntion raises exceptions, list those
