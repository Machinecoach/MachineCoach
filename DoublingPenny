#I made this code because my daughter and I read a book called "G is for Googol" which is an ABC book with math topics.  
#In it they talk about the concept of getting $5,000,000 today or getting a penny that doubles everyday for 30 days. 
#She very much enjoys asking me to input larger and larger numbers to see how long they are when I copy them into notepad.


n = int(input("Input what day it is in the month:"))
double = 0
for integer in (range(n)):
    double += 0+(2**integer)
    print(double)
