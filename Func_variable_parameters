#def function with variable list of parameters utilizing *

#args is not required below, but it is a python norm and other devs understand it
def addition(*args):
    result = 0
    for arg in args:
        result += arg
    return result

#Drawback:  if you change a variable argument in a function you have to change all of the places where function is used.
#example of this drawback would be if I added a variable and a comma in front of *args above
#useful when number of parameters is small

#TODO: define a function that takes variable arguments
def main():
    # TODO: pass different arguments
    print(addition(5, 10, 15, 20))
    print(addition(1, 2, 3))

    #TODO: pass an existing list
    myNums = [5, 10, 15, 20]
    print(addition(*myNums))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
